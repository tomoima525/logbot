## What's this for?

There's a case when you want to show logs on top your app. Well, I do when I'm not in front of my
lap top but want to check the logs. Or sometimes QA team wants to check logs but it's a hassle to
see the debug log through IDE or with adb command.

This library displays a window that opens on top of your app. You can send any log on the window
and allows you to see it across the screen. You can also share the log and share them.
